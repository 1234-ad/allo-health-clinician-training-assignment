# Allo Health - Clinician Training & Excellence Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Clinician Training & Excellence Internship Assignment at Allo Health. The assignment focuses on proposing improvements to the current clinician onboarding and training process.

## Assignment Brief
Allo Health's current clinician training process includes:
1. **Hiring & Offer Stage** - HR documentation and offer completion
2. **Self-paced Training Modules** - 4 hours/day over 7-8 days with quizzes
3. **Mock Consultations** - 6-7 practice sessions with evaluation
4. **Feedback & Go-Live** - Final approval or additional training

## My Proposed Solutions

### Initiative 1: Adaptive Learning Pathways with AI-Powered Personalization
**Problem**: One-size-fits-all training doesn't account for varying experience levels and learning speeds
**Solution**: Implement adaptive learning system that customizes training based on clinician background
**Implementation**: Phased rollout with pilot group, AI assessment integration
**Impact**: Reduced training time by 25%, improved knowledge retention by 40%

### Initiative 2: Real-Time Performance Analytics Dashboard
**Problem**: Limited visibility into training progress and performance bottlenecks
**Solution**: Comprehensive dashboard tracking learning metrics and predictive success indicators
**Implementation**: Integration with existing LMS, stakeholder training, iterative improvements
**Impact**: 30% faster identification of at-risk trainees, improved pass rates

### Initiative 3: Peer-to-Peer Learning Network
**Problem**: Isolated learning experience with limited peer interaction and knowledge sharing
**Solution**: Structured mentorship program and collaborative learning platform
**Implementation**: Mentor matching system, regular check-ins, knowledge sharing sessions
**Impact**: Increased confidence scores, reduced time-to-competency, better retention
